🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📊 1. Sales Performance Overview

Total Revenue: ₹681.76 Million

Peak Revenue Months: Mid-year, with a decline towards year-end

Sales Trend: 2020-2022 stable, but drop in 2023


📈 Visualized using Line Charts & Area Graphs

🏷️ 2. Revenue Trends Across Categories

Top-selling categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home, Books

Female customers generate higher revenue across all categories

Males contribute less revenue, possibly due to lower spending frequency


📊 Visualized using Bar Charts


💳 3. Payment Methods Analysis

Most Used: Credit Card (39%) & PayPal (38%)

Least Used: Cash (23%)

Digital payments dominate, indicating customer preference for online transactions


📊 Visualized using Pie Charts & Bar Charts


📉 4. Customer Behavior & Revenue by Gender

Female customers contribute 58% of total revenue

Male customers contribute 42%

Targeted marketing strategies can increase male customer engagement

📦 5. Product Returns & Customer Preferences

Clothing has the highest return rate (size/style issues)

Books have the lowest return rate

Digital payment methods (Credit Card & PayPal) have more returns, likely due to easy refund policies

📊 Visualized using Bar Charts

👥 6. Age-Wise Customer Analysis

Even distribution of purchases across age groups (18-70 years)

Slight decline at younger & older age ranges


📊 Visualized using Histograms


🏆 7. Top 10 High-Value Customers

Michael Johnson is the highest spender

High-spending customers contribute significantly to revenue

📊 Visualized using Bar Charts
