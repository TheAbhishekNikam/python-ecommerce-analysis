# E-commerce Sales Data Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an e-commerce dataset with over 250,000 customer transactions. Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, key insights on sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue patterns are extracted.

## Key Objectives
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values and duplicates
- Sales Performance Analysis – Monthly & yearly revenue trends
- Customer Behavior Analysis – Gender-based & age-wise spending patterns
- Payment Methods Analysis – Most preferred payment modes
- Product Category Insights – Best-selling & most returned products
- Visualization & Reporting – Line charts, bar graphs, pie charts, boxplots

## Files Included
- **Ecommerce_Data_Analysis.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- **Dataset.csv** – Dataset used for analysis
- **Ecommerce_Data_Analysis.pdf** – Project report with visualizations
- **README.md** – Project documentation

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains over 250,000 customer transactions with key attributes such as:
- Customer ID, Name, Age, Gender
- Purchase Date, Product Category, Quantity
- Total Purchase Amount, Payment Method
- Returns & Churn Data

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Sales Performance Overview
- Total Revenue: ₹681.76 Million
- Peak Revenue Months: Mid-year, with a decline towards year-end
- Sales Trend: 2020-2022 stable, but drop in 2023
- Visualized using Line Charts & Area Graphs

### 2. Revenue Trends Across Categories
- Top-selling categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home, Books
- Female customers generate higher revenue across all categories
- Males contribute less revenue, possibly due to lower spending frequency
- Visualized using Bar Charts

### 3. Payment Methods Analysis
- Most Used: Credit Card (39%) & PayPal (38%)
- Least Used: Cash (23%)
- Digital payments dominate, indicating customer preference for online transactions
- Visualized using Pie Charts & Bar Charts

### 4. Customer Behavior & Revenue by Gender
- Female customers contribute 58% of total revenue
- Male customers contribute 42%
- Targeted marketing strategies can increase male customer engagement
- Visualized using Pie Charts

### 5. Product Returns & Customer Preferences
- Clothing has the highest return rate (size/style issues)
- Books have the lowest return rate
- Digital payment methods (Credit Card & PayPal) have more returns, likely due to easy refund policies
- Visualized using Bar Charts

### 6. Age-Wise Customer Analysis
- Even distribution of purchases across age groups (18-70 years)
- Slight decline at younger & older age ranges
- Visualized using Histograms

### 7. Top 10 High-Value Customers
- Michael Johnson is the highest spender
- High-spending customers contribute significantly to revenue
- Visualized using Bar Charts

## Libraries Used
- pandas – Data manipulation
- numpy – Numerical analysis
- seaborn – Data visualization
- matplotlib – Plotting graphs
- warnings – Suppressing warnings

## Key Takeaways
- Sales trends indicate seasonal revenue fluctuations
- Female customers dominate e-commerce spending
- Credit Card & PayPal are the most used payment methods
- Clothing has the highest return rate
- Revenue dropped significantly in 2023, requiring further investigation
